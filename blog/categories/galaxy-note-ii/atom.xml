    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I accidently dropped my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it’s display broke.
It’s a 3 year old device on which I didn’t want to spend another penny, so I wasn’t
sad but worried about my data in the Internal Storage of the phone.
The screen was completely dead, even the touch was not working.</p>

<p>The main problem was that the Pattern lock was enabled, due to which I wasn’t
able to connect the phone in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol" title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</a>
mode, and <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html" title="Android Debug Bridge">ADB</a>
showed the device as <code>unauthorized</code>.
At this point I was wondering why I didn’t backup everything before, it was frustrating.</p>

<p>After hours of searching through the web, I found a few solutions, but none of them
were helpful as</p>

<ul>
  <li>My phone was locked.</li>
  <li>USB Debugging was disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, I found this tool on XDA called
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2339530" title="ADB Data Recovery">ADB Data Recovery</a>
by <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4507027" title="XDA user FuzzyMeep Two">FuzzyMeep Two</a>.
Sadly, it was a tool for Windows and I had a Linux and a Mac machine.
Luckily, I found what the tool actually does by going through the thread.
The tool uses the command <code>adb pull</code> to fetch data from the phone’s storage.
But, for that to work you need to have a <code>Custom Recovery</code> installed on your phone, which
in my case was already there.
So, it turned out to be very easy for people who usually install Custom ROMs on
their Android devices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boot your phone into recovery mode.</li>
  <li>Connect your phone to the computer via USB.
    <ul>
      <li>Check if your phone is connected properly using <code>adb devices</code>.</li>
      <li>You will see a unique ID of your phone and the text <code>recovery</code> after it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now to backup your data use the <code>adb pull</code> command:
  <code>adb pull &lt;source-path&gt; &lt;target-path&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I found this nice <a href="http://www.droidviews.com/push-pull-files-android-using-adb-commands/" title="adb pull">article</a>
explaining the use case of <code>adb pull</code> command.</p>

<p>So, to sum it all up, if you can somehow install custom recovery on your phone,
you can save all your shit.</p>

<p>PS: Screenshots coming soon.</p>
